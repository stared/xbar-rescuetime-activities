# RescueTime activities - a xbar plugin

See your RescueTime activities and distractions in a macOS menu bar - an xbar plugin

You need:

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later; tested on 14.5 (Sonoma)
- [xbar](https://github.com/matryer/xbar) (the BitBar reboot)
- [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) account
- [RescueTime API key](https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/manage), manually put in `~/Library/RescueTime.com/api.key` file.

The plugin is inspired by [RescueTime plugin](https://xbarapp.com/docs/plugins/Dev/rescuetime.1h.py.html) by [Paul Traylor](https://github.com/kfdm).
I rewrote it, as I wanted to see the list of concrete activities, rather than just a summary of productive and not distractive time.
